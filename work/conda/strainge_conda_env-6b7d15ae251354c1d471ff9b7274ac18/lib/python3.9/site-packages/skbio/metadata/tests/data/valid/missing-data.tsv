# Missing data can be represented with empty cells or whitespace-only cells.
# Test that values used to represent missing data in other programs
# (e.g. pandas) are not treated as missing (e.g. "NA", "N/A"). Also test
# columns that consist solely of missing data. By default, an empty column will
# be treated as numeric data (column "NA" in this example). "col4" overrides
# this behavior to make its empty column categorical.

id	col1	NA	col3	col4
#q2:types				categorical
None	1		null	
nan			N/A	
NA	  	"	 "	NA
